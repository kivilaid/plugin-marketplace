# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture

### Marketplace Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Catalog of available plugins
plugins/                          # Plugin implementations
  {plugin-name}/
    plugin.json                   # Plugin manifest
    commands/*.md                 # Slash command definitions
    agents/*.md                   # Agent system prompts
    hooks/hooks.json              # Event hook configuration
    hooks/*.sh                    # Hook executables
    mcp-servers/*.js              # MCP server implementations
.mcp.json                         # MCP server config (for CI/CD)
.github/workflows/claude.yml      # Claude Code Action workflow
```

### Skills vs Plugins

This marketplace contains both **plugins** and **skills**:

- **Plugins**: Traditional Claude Code plugins with commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers (e.g., `example-full-featured`)
- **Skills**: Specialized instruction sets with YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md` files (e.g., `document-skills`, `example-skills`)

Skills are simpler than full plugins - they're folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and instructions. Claude loads them dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks.

**Key Difference:**
- Plugins can have commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers
- Skills are instruction-only (no executable components)
- Skills use `SKILL.md` with frontmatter; plugins use `plugin.json`

### Plugin System Components

1. **Commands** (`commands/*.md`): Markdown files containing instructions for slash commands
   - Front matter defines `allowed-tools` and `description`
   - Body contains instructions and can use `!`git command`` for dynamic context
   - Commands appear as `/command-name` in Claude Code

2. **Agents** (`agents/*.md`): Specialized agent system prompts
   - Markdown files with system prompt instructions
   - Invoked via Task tool with subagent_type matching filename
   - Examples: code-reviewer, test-generator

3. **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`): Event-driven automation
   - `PostToolUse` hooks trigger after tool usage (e.g., Write, Edit)
   - Can execute shell scripts with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable
   - Example: validate.sh runs syntax checks after file changes

4. **MCP Servers** (`mcp-servers/*.js`): Model Context Protocol servers
   - Node.js executables implementing MCP protocol
   - Extend Claude with custom tools
   - Environment variables configured in plugin.json

### MCP Configuration

The `.mcp.json` file configures remote MCP servers for CI/CD:

- **context7**: Documentation retrieval server at `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`
- **playwright**: Browser automation server at `https://playwright-mcp.ando-kivilaid.workers.dev/mcp`

MCP tools must be explicitly allowed in workflow `claude_args`:
```yaml
--allowedTools mcp__context7__resolve-library-id mcp__context7__get-library-docs mcp__playwright__*
```

## Development Workflow

### Testing Plugins Locally

```bash
# Add marketplace to Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add /Users/ando/github/plugin-marketplace

# Install plugin from local marketplace
/plugin install example-full-featured@example-marketplace

# Test slash commands
/commit
/commit-push-pr
/clean_gone

# Uninstall for testing changes
/plugin uninstall example-full-featured
```

### Validating Plugin Structure

No automated validation tools currently exist. Manual validation:
1. Ensure `plugin.json` has required fields: name, version, description
2. Verify commands/agents are valid markdown with proper front matter
3. Test hooks execute without errors
4. Confirm MCP servers implement protocol correctly

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/claude.yml` workflow:
- Triggers on `@AndoAI` mentions in issues/PRs/comments
- Runs Claude Code Action with OAuth token
- Auto-detects `.mcp.json` for MCP server configuration
- Allows specific MCP tools via `--allowedTools` in `claude_args`
- Uses custom bot name "AndoAI" instead of default "claude[bot]"

## Key Implementation Details

### Environment Variables in Plugins

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: Absolute path to the plugin directory
- Custom env vars defined in `plugin.json` → `mcpServers` → `env`

### Command Front Matter Syntax

Commands use YAML front matter with special fields:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*)
description: Brief description
---
```

### Dynamic Context in Commands

Use `!`command`` syntax to inject command output into prompts:
```markdown
- Current git status: !`git status`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`
```

### Hook Matchers

Hooks use regex-style matchers for tool names:
- `"Write|Edit"` matches Write OR Edit tools
- Supports `{{file_path}}` template variable for hook arguments

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Plugin

1. Create directory: `plugins/{plugin-name}/`
2. Create `plugin.json` manifest
3. Add plugin entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
4. Add components (commands/agents/hooks/mcp-servers) as needed
5. Test locally before committing

### Modifying MCP Configuration

1. Edit `.mcp.json` to add/modify servers
2. Update workflow `claude_args` to allow new MCP tools
3. Test in CI/CD by triggering workflow with `@AndoAI`

### Updating Workflow Permissions

The workflow requires specific GitHub permissions:
- `contents: write` - For creating commits/branches
- `pull-requests: write` - For PR operations
- `issues: write` - For issue comments
- `id-token: write` - For OIDC authentication
- `actions: read` - For reading CI results

## Important Constraints

- Plugin names must be unique within marketplace
- MCP server names in `.mcp.json` must match tool prefixes (`mcp__{name}__tool`)
- Hooks cannot modify Claude's response, only validate/notify
- Commands should avoid complex logic - delegate to tools/agents
- Slash commands cannot have spaces in their names
